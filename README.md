# Windows 10 Safe Edition
Windows 10 safe edition is a Windows 10 iso I am making, it would just be normal Windows 10 but safer since Windows 10 is ending official support from Microsoft on October 2025. So I made an iso to keep us safe online while using Windows 10, I can't make an official download since I could get suied my Microsoft so I made a recipie on how to make it. It's still under development so I still can't add the official recipie on how to make it. 

#About Windows 10 Safe Edition
So the tools I'm using to make this iso is a tool called NTLite which you can use to modify modern Windows isos but if you want to modify an old Windows iso like Windows xp then you need NLite. For now I've planned some stuff I could add like maybe a feature that the internet automatically disconnects when you close your browser so then you don't have to do it your self because sometimes you can forget, also there would be a time limit for internet usage, I don't know if I can make the internet time limit set depending what you do with the internet so if you are doing something that makes it easier to get malware then the time limit gets shorter. I will remove some software like Mail, Calendar, Cortana etc and also some features. And it would have preinstalled software like antivirueses, a safe web browser. I will decide more what to add and remove.

#Important Things to Note
1. When the recipie will finally get released, make sure to do it before October 18 2025 and make sure it's updated to the latest update every year.
2. Make sure to make a backup of all your pc's data on a USB or something just incase if you still manage to get malware after October 2025.
3. Sometimes you can just use it on a VM on a pc running windows 11 if you feel unsafe on the internet.
